title: 'Finishing My Own Website'

Well, after promising myself to finish writing my own website for so long, I have finally done it. It was no big deal,
just something I had come up with in Next.js and then compiling them into a static website, but it was considerably more
work than I had thought, and I think much more about front-end developers now.

I think I would like to work more on the website, but then there are a lot of other stuff to do. I still need to find
my old projects that still have some form of files and maybe finish them, because the projects tab is looking kind of
empty right now.

I would probably need to familiarise myself with Markdown again, given that this is now written in that. Hopefully this
investment in ease of input would result in me writing more of this. Until then, I will try and polish the website a bit
more I think.
